Eulogy website for my mother, Carolyn McFadyen. Originally built on Gandi.net's blog system but due to their lack of upgrade path its now static HTML and hosted here on github. 

All remote gandi.ws resources were copied to a local gandi folder, to avoid the site breaking when they remove the files.
